# Virtual-Mouse
The virtual mouse offers users a more comfortable and intuitive way to interact with their computers, especially for individuals who have injuries or disabilities that prevent them from using a traditional mouse
This project offers an alternative to the conventional approaches, which involve manually pressing buttons or repositioning a physical computer mouse. Instead, it makes use of a camera and computer vision software to manage different mouse events and can complete all of the tasks that a conventional computer mouse can. The Virtual Mouse colour recognition programmer will continuously acquire real-time photos and convert and filter them as needed. Once everything has been converted, the application will use image processing to extract the coordinates of the specified colour position from the converted frames. Following that, it will compare the current colour schemes within the frames to a list of colour combinations, where various combinations correspond to various mouse actions. If the current colours combination found a match, the program will execute the mouse function, which will be translated into an actual mouse function to the users' machine
